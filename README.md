Matt here,
Still very green with a lot of programming. I like the easy stuff. [Python. Javascript.]
I'm interested in a lot of things and programming helps all of them. [CNC machining, Design, Engineering, Content creation, etc.]
I love finding alternative uses for things people have spent a lot of time on.
Once of my greatest joys is finding something that is common in one field and little known in another and connecting them.
I am very dumb and it seems to take a while for me to catch on, but I love learning new things and one can't let a bad brain get in the way of progress.
